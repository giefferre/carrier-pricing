# Carrier Pricing

REST API golang example, used to calculate delivery pricing according to different vehicles/carriers ðŸšš

The repository is structured to provide an application which actually serves REST API requests, to calculate the price of the parcel delivery service. In the same time, such repository could be imported in other applications as well, as the HTTP server is separated from the service package itself.

## Available APIs

- `/quotes` or `/quotes/basic`: provides users with a basic calculation of the delivery service price between two post codes
- `/quotes/byvehicle`: provides users with a calculation of the delivery service price between two post codes; the price will change according to the specific vehicle the user wants
- `/quotes/bycarrier` (work in progress): provides users with the list of all the prices for a delivery of a parcel using different vehicles and different carriers

REST examples are available in the [docs/examples](docs/examples) folder.
They are meant to be used on [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) [REST Client plugin](https://github.com/Huachao/vscode-restclient).
